 * the slack in the user's space is s*(c + A'y) -- equivalently -s*(slx+sux), the

 * no cost (the CBF example C.2, where this was first pinned) cannot tell the two
 * apart, while one whose dual sits ON the boundary of K* can, and C.2's block was
 * the reflection of a boundary point -- the sign of the cone, not a rounding.
 * Two shapes make a block unreadable, and it is left unmeasured rather than
 * measured wrong: a member with a finite bound, whose bound multiplier is not
 * separable from the cone's in what is published, and a model with a quadratic
 * row or objective, whose gradient term belongs in d and is not in this sum.

/* Whether a solve that is about to publish on a cone-only model may call itself

 * the primal residual (0 at the vertex) nor the gap (mu*nu, by construction) but
 * the reduced cost of the block, which has to sit in K*. Measured on
 * `min -x0` over one free 3-D QUAD block: the route returned rc=OK, solsta=

 * tolerance the task DECLARES widened by the near-optimal factor -- the same
 * effective tolerance sdp_ipm's gate uses, so the two cannot disagree about a
 * point both of them could see.
 * Refusing the point is the cheap half of the decision; saying what the model
 * instead is needs a direction, so a refused point is put to the same test the
 * bar cap uses: a recession direction MEASURED on the model's own rows and cones

 * Main optimization routine: solves the optimization problem.

 *         PRIMAL_RES_ERR_NULL if t is NULL,
 *         PRIMAL_RES_ERR_ARG if the model is invalid (e.g., invalid bounds),
 *         PRIMAL_RES_TRM_MAX_ITER if iteration limit reached,
 *         PRIMAL_RES_TRM_MAX_TIME if time limit reached,
 *         PRIMAL_RES_TRM_OBJECTIVE_RANGE if objective cut triggered,
 *         PRIMAL_RES_ERR_INFEASIBLE if primal infeasible (certificate available via getdualray),
 *         PRIMAL_RES_ERR_UNBOUNDED if dual infeasible (certificate available via getprimalray),
 *         Other error codes for specific failure modes.
 *
 * @note This is the main entry point for solving. The function dispatches to
 *       the appropriate solver based on the model structure:
 *       - MIP (integer variables, semi-continuous, SOS): branch & bound
 *       - SDP (PSD variables): primal-dual IPM with tangent-cut fallback
 *       - QP with cones / quadratic constraints: RQUAD encoding + conic IPM
 *       - Pure conic (SOC/exp-power): unified conic IPM (native or tangent-cut)
 *       - LP/QP: Mehrotra IPM or dense simplex
 *
 *       The solver evaluates wall-clock time limits (PRIMAL_DPAR_OPTIMIZER_MAX_TIME,
 *       PRIMAL_DPAR_MIO_MAX_TIME), objective cuts (PRIMAL_DPAR_LOWER_OBJ_CUT,
 *       PRIMAL_DPAR_UPPER_OBJ_CUT), and iteration limits.
 *
 *       After a successful solve, the solution is available via getxx, gety, etc.
 *       For infeasible/unbounded problems, certificates are available via
 *       getdualray/getprimalray (LP/QP only; conic/SDP/MIP do not publish certificates).
 *
 *       The conic/SDP path includes a "fourth face" check: the published point
 *       must satisfy cone membership (PSD, SOC, exp-power) within tolerances.
 *       If not, the point is refused and the model is interrogated for a
 *       certificate (unbounded direction or infeasibility ray).
 *
 * @example
 * PRIMALrescodee rc = PRIMAL_optimize(task);
